# USR Lab Team Folder Naming Concention

This repos describes the naming convention of Uppsala Social Robotics Lab.

---
 - Keep folder and file names short.
 - Use a *README.txt* to describe what is contained in the folder.
 - Use '-' for seperators in the file names and use upper camel case for folder naming (e.g. UpperCamelCase). 
 - Do not use illegal web characters '.'()', '/', '&', etc.
 - Do not use spaces in any folder or file name (these appear as an ugly '%20' in the URL).
 - Build no more than 3 levels of Folders.
 - Reference the short version of the URL when sending to others to use ('How To Shorten SharePoint URLs).
 - For sorting by filename, use consistent naming conventionse.g.,  2015-01-15 sorts after  2014-11-07.
